    <h2>INDIAN NAVY</h2>
    <h4 class="h4"> <a href="">APPLY HERE</a> </h4>
    <p> The Indian Navy (Bhāratīya Nau Sēnā) is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of
        India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the
        navy.
        The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the East India Company's Marine which was founded in 1612 to protect
        British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793, the British East India Company established its rule over
        eastern part of the Indian subcontinent i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial navy was titled
        as His Majesty's Indian Navy. When India became a republic in 1950, the Royal Indian Navy as it had been named
        since 1934 was renamed to Indian Navy.
        The primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation's maritime borders, and in conjunction with other
        Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or
        maritime interests of India, both in war and peace. Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian
        missions, including disaster relief, Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations between nations.
        As of June 2019, Indian Navy has 67,252 active and 55,000 reserve personnel in service and has a fleet of 295
        ships, boats and 246 aircraft.As of March 2018, the operational fleet consists of one aircraft
        carrier, one amphibious transport dock, eight landing ship tanks, eleven destroyers, fourteen frigates, one
        nuclear-powered attack submarine, one ballistic missile submarine, fifteen conventionally-powered attack
        submarines, twenty-two corvettes, one mine countermeasure vessel, four fleet tankers and various other
        auxiliary vessels.
