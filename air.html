        <h2>INDIAN AIR FORCE</h2>
    </a>
    <h4 class="h4"> <a href="">APPLY HERE</a> </h4>
    <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft
        assets ranks fourth amongst the air forces of the world. Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and
        to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary
        air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix
        Royal. After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was
        kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in 1950, the
        prefix Royal was removed.
        Since 1950 the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighboring Pakistan and one with the People's Republic
        of China. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation
        Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the IAF
        participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
        The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF. As of 1 July 2017, 139,576 personnel
        are in service with the Indian Air Force. The Chief of Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star
        officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one
        serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the
        President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002 Singh became the first and so
        far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.
